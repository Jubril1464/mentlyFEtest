UIFRY

A Next.js application built using React hooks, TypeScript, Zod, clsx, Swiper, react-chartjs-2, and tailwind-merge.

Project Setup

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (latest LTS recommended)

npm or yarn

Installation
1. Clone the repository:

npm install
# or
yarn install

Running the Project

To start the development server:
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
This will start the application at http://localhost:3000/.


Assumptions Made During Development
The project structure follows a modular and scalable pattern.

TypeScript is used for type safety.

Zod is used for form validation.

Tailwind CSS is used for styling with tailwind-merge for optimized class merging.

clsx is used to conditionally join class names.

Swiper is used for implementing carousels/sliders.

react-chartjs-2 is used for visualizing data with charts.
